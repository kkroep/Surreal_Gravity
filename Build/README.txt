The controls of the game can be found under:
Settings > Instructions

**************
*SINGLEPLAYER*
**************

To play singleplayer, you can press the singleplayer button. It's not much fun, but you can experiment with the gravity switches.
Alternately, you can do the following to play singleplayer mode:

multiplayer > start server > start game
Now you have made your own server in which you are the only player. Enjoy!

*************
*MULTIPLAYER*
*************

For multiplayer you need two players with different accounts.
You can login by:

account > fill in username > fill in password > click login

The accounts currently available are:

usrname/psswrd:

Kees/Kees
Coen/Coen
Steven/Steven
Ayyoeb/Ayyoeb
Kwok/Kwok
Roberto/Roberto
AB/BA

If you want, you can register your own account!

When you are logged in you can make a server by:
	Multiplayer > start server
Another player with a different account can then access the server by:
	Multiplayer > refresh > #names's server
The client will appear in the lobby. The Server can start the game with <start game>

As a server you can change the modus (fork or railgun), enable or disable the no-jump mode, set the amount of level-destroying robots and choose the amount of points you have to reach in order to win.

Note that you can't join a server which has already begun!

You can exit the lobby by clicking the disconnect option. If you are a client, the lobby remains intact. If you are a server, however, everyone gets kicked out of the lobby.
You can exit the game at any time, while playing the game, by pressing the escape key. If you are a client, the rest can play on. If you are a server, however, everyone will return to the main menu.

*SETTINGS*
**********
You can disable/enable the music in the settings menu. You can also change (and save) your mouse sensitivity in-game.

*******
*STATS*
*******
In the Stats Menu, you can find some fun global data (like total games played), and some data of your account specifically (amount of wins etc). Make sure to check it out, as long as the webserver is open!

***disclaimer***
We recommend to not use the same accounts if you are logging in via the webserver. It should work, but it will mess up your stats most likely.
